<ul>
<li><H2><I>5G Technology</I></H2></li>

  <h3>5G is the Fifth Generation mobile broadband, beyond Long-term Evolution (LTE) mobile networks.<br> It is a 
    game-changer and a trending technology, that improves our network connections. Through this,<br> we
     will get faster, stable, and secure connections. Hence, shortly, we will have 5G mobiles in our hands.</h3>

<li><H2><I>Social Media</I></H2></li>

<h3>Social media is a computer-based technology that facilitates the sharing of ideas, thoughts, and information<br> through
   the building of virtual networks
   and communities. ... Users engage with social media via a computer,<br> tablet, or smartphone 
   via web-based software or applications.</h3><img src="Socialmedia.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Virtual Reality</I></H2></li>

<H3>VR headsets are essentially just machines designed to replace our surroundings with something created<br> in software. There are gyroscopic sensors, accelerators,
   and magnetometers in headsets to determine how<br> you move and track your interactions with a virtual space..</H3></h3><img src="lol.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Bitcoins</I></H2></li>

<H3>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single
   administrator, that can be sent from<br> user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network 
   without the need for intermediaries.</H3></h3><img src="BITCOINS.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Cybersecurity</I></H2></li>

<H3>Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security is the protection of computer systems 
  <br>and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to
   their hardware, software, or electronic data,<br> as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide</H3></h3><img src="CYBER.JPG" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Intelligent Apps</I></H2></li>

<H3>Intelligent Apps are applications that make use of historical and real-time data from user interactions and<br> many other sources
   to make predictions and suggestions. Different AI components, such as Machine Learning,<br> robotics, general intelligence, expert 
   systems, and NLP, are used in developing Intelligent Apps.
   As an intelligent app <br>is used, it increases what it learns and uses predictive analytics to quickly adapt to the information 
   it receives.<br>Intelligent
    apps use built-in machine learning algorithms to process vast amounts of data to continuously improve performance
  </H3></h3><img src="IA.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Robotic Process Automation</I></H2></li>

<H3>
  
  Robotic process automation is a form of business process automation technology based on 
  metaphorical software<BR> robots or on artificial intelligence /digital workers. It is sometimes
   referred to as software robotics</H3></h3><img src="RPA.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Machine Learning</I></H2></li>

<H3>Machine Learning (ML) is a set of algorithms that find and apply patterns to data. ML is a trending <br>technology
   that discovers rules causing a problem by using the data and finds a solution to that problem.</H3></h3><img src="MI.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>Augmented Reality</I></H2></li>

<H3>Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the<br> 
  objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual,<br> information, sometimes across
   multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic,<br> somatosensory and olfactory.<H3></h3><img src="AR.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>

<li><H2><I>DevOps</I></H2></li>
<H3>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases
   an organization's<br> ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving
   products at a faster<br> pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure
    management processes.<H3></h3><img src="DO.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>
